    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // const copyList = players

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // copyList[2] = 'kang'

    // now here is the problem!
    // console.log(copyList)
    // console.log(players)

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    // const copy2 = players.slice()
    // copy2[2] = 'kang'
    // console.log(copy2)
    // console.log(players)

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    // const copy3 = players.concat([])
    // copy3[2] = 'kang'
    // console.log(copy3)
    // console.log(players)

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    // console.clear()
    // const copy4 = [...players]
    // copy4[2] = 'kang'
    // console.log(copy4)
    // console.log(players)

    // const copy5 = Array.from(players)
    // copy5[2] = 'kang'
    // console.log(copy5)
    // console.log(players)

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const obj1 = Object.assign({}, person)
    obj1.email = 'kang@163.com'
    console.log(person)
    console.log(obj1)

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
